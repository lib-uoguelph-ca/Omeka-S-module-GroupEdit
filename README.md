# GroupEdit (module for Omeka S)
The GroupEdit module for Omeka S extends the [Group module](https://github.com/Daniel-KM/Omeka-S-module-Group/blob/master/README.md). 
While the Group module enables users in the same group to see each others resources, the GroupEdit module extends those privileges, allowing users to edit and delete those resources.

The GroupEdit module is designed to support users who would like to collaborate on a single project without sharing login credentials.

## Installation

1. Extract the files in your modules directory, and rename module folder "GroupEdit". See general end user documentation for [installing a module](http://dev.omeka.org/docs/s/user-manual/modules/#installing-modules).
2. Ensure that the Group module is installed and enabled.
3. Enable the module. 

## Usage

See the [Group](https://github.com/Daniel-KM/Omeka-S-module-Group/blob/master/README.md) module for usage instructions. Once the GroupEdit module is enabled, authors will be able to edit resources that are owned by the groups they belong to.

## Warning

Use this module at your own risk.

Itâ€™s always recommended to backup your files and your databases before using a new module.
